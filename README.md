# Adaptive Chess Engine

A chess engine that **adapts to your playing style** instead of using fixed difficulty levels. This project was developed as an academic project at IIT Bombay (IITB). The engine learns whether you're aggressive, defensive, tactical, or positional and dynamically adjusts its evaluation function to provide a challenging and personalized gameplay experience.

## 🎯 Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Adaptive Learning System**: Analyzes your move history to detect long-term playing tendencies
- **Player Profiling**: Maintains persistent profiles with statistical analysis across multiple games
- **Dynamic Evaluation Function**: Modifies evaluation weights in real-time based on detected playing style
- **Full Chess Engine**: Complete implementation with:
  - Board representation
  - Move generation
  - Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning
  - Position evaluation
- **Modern GUI**: Clean Tkinter-based interface with:
  - Move highlighting
  - Player style indicators (aggressive %, defensive %, tactical %, positional %)
  - Game status display

### Adaptive Behavior

The engine adapts in the following ways:

- **Against Aggressive Players**: Increases king safety and defensive weights
- **Against Defensive Players**: Increases attack and central control weights
- **Against Tactical Players**: Focuses on solid positions and avoids tactical traps
- **Against Positional Players**: Increases piece activity and tactical play

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies (uses only Python standard library)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory

### Running the Game

**Quick Start (using Makefile):**
```bash
make
```

**Using Python directly:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

The project includes a Makefile for easy single-command execution:

```bash
# Run with default settings
make
make run

# Quick run
make quick

# Custom player
make player PLAYER_ID=my_name PLAYER_NAME="My Name"

# Custom depth
make depth DEPTH=5

# Combined custom options
make run PLAYER_ID=alice PLAYER_NAME="Alice" DEPTH=6

# Other useful commands
make clean          # Remove cache files
make clean-profiles # Remove all profiles
make check          # Check code syntax
make test           # Run basic tests
make help           # Show all commands
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
python main.py --player-id my_id --player-name "My Name" --depth 5
```

Options:
- `--player-id`: Unique identifier for your player profile (default: `default_player`)
- `--player-name`: Display name (default: `Player`)
- `--depth`: Engine search depth (default: `4`, higher = stronger but slower)

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Run `python main.py`
2. **Make moves**: Click on a piece to select it, then click on the destination square
3. **Watch the adaptation**: The engine learns your style as you play - check the "Player Style Analysis" panel
4. **New game**: Click "New Game" to start a fresh game while keeping your profile

## 🔬 How Adaptive Learning Works

The engine tracks various statistics from your moves:

1. **Aggression Score**: Based on captures, checks, and attacking moves
2. **Defensive Score**: Based on defensive moves and piece protection
3. **Tactical Score**: Based on tactical sequences and piece exchanges
4. **Positional Score**: Based on central control and positional moves
5. **Trade Willingness**: How often you trade pieces
6. **King Safety Focus**: How much you focus on king safety
7. **Central Control**: Preference for central squares

Every few moves, the engine:
- Updates your profile statistics
- Determines your primary playing style
- Adjusts its evaluation weights accordingly
- Saves your profile for future games

See [docs/ADAPTIVE_LEARNING.md](docs/ADAPTIVE_LEARNING.md) for detailed information.

## 📊 Player Profiles

Player profiles are stored in the `profiles/` directory as JSON files. Each profile contains:
- Game statistics (games played, moves recorded)
- Style indicators (aggression, defense, tactical, positional)
- Tendency scores (trade willingness, king safety, etc.)
- Move history (for analysis)

Profiles persist across games, so the engine remembers your style!

## 🛠️ Architecture

The system is designed with clear separation of concerns:

- **Engine**: Pure chess engine logic (no learning)
- **Adaptive Logic**: Learning and adaptation algorithms
- **Player Profile**: Data management and persistence
- **GUI**: User interface (completely separate from engine logic)

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## 🔧 Extending the System

### Adding New Evaluation Parameters

1. Add weight to `evaluation.py` in `_get_default_weights()`
2. Implement evaluation function in `EvaluationFunction` class
3. Update `weight_adapter.py` to adapt the new weight based on player style

### Adding New Style Indicators

1. Add analysis in `style_analyzer.py`
2. Update `PlayerProfile` to store the new indicator
3. Update `weight_adapter.py` to use the new indicator

### Customizing Adaptation Logic

Modify `weight_adapter.py` in the `adapt_to_player()` method to change how the engine adapts to different playing styles.

## 📈 Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:

- [ ] Opening book integration
- [ ] Endgame tablebase support
- [ ] More sophisticated learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks)
- [ ] Multiple difficulty levels within adaptive mode
- [ ] Game replay and analysis features
- [ ] Online multiplayer support
- [ ] Move hint system
- [ ] Evaluation bar visualization
- [ ] Save/load game positions

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Simplified check detection (may not catch all check patterns)
- Basic castling rules (doesn't check if squares are attacked)
- No threefold repetition or 50-move rule detection
- Evaluation function is basic (can be improved with more features)
